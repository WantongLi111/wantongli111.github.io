Welcome!  
This page highlights public tools and reproducible workflows I develop for studying terrestrial ecosystems, climate, and socio-environmental change.

## 1. Syndromes of biosphere–atmosphere–socioeconomic change

This project builds “syndromes of change” – characteristic patterns that link shifts in ecosystems, climate, and socioeconomic conditions around the world. It provides a reproducible pipeline from raw satellite and socio-economic data to interpretable indicators of coupled biosphere–atmosphere–society change.

Use this workflow to:
- explore how vegetation, water stress, and climate co-vary with socio-economic indicators  
- identify regions that share similar “syndromes” of change  
- reproduce figures from the paper and generate new syndrome maps or extreme-event case studies

## 2. Global vegetation physiology under drought

This project develops a method to extract global vegetation physiological responses to drought by combining  
**sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)**, **vegetation optical depth (VOD)**, and **land surface temperature (LST)**. It separates structural and physiological controls on ecosystem function and produces global indicators of photosynthetic down-regulation and stomatal stress during and after drought.

Typical applications include:
- quantifying physiological vs structural contributions to changes in carbon uptake and evaporation  
- mapping global patterns of vegetation physiological stress and recovery under drought  
- benchmarking land-surface and Earth system model drought responses in terms of vegetation physiology

## 3. Vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture (interpretable ML)

This project develops interpretable machine-learning methods to quantify vegetation sensitivity to soil moisture across climate gradients. It uses observation-based datasets and transparent models to estimate how changes in near-surface and root-zone soil moisture affect vegetation productivity and greenness, and to map where ecosystems are most vulnerable to water limitation and drought propagation.

Use this workflow to:
- derive sensitivity metrics linking soil moisture anomalies to vegetation responses  
- compare the relative role of near-surface vs root-zone water availability  
- benchmark land-surface and Earth system model representations of ecohydrological limitation

These archives contain all scripts and analysis-ready inputs needed to reproduce the results and figures described in the associated manuscript.
