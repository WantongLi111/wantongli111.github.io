    <div class="talk-text">
      A Sino–German workshop connecting sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) with field measurements and ecosystem modeling.
      We exchanged research ideas, held hands-on discussions with undergraduate and graduate students in physical geography, and engaged with the
      Huangshan National Reserve forest protection station to bridge scientific advances with long-term forest monitoring and conservation practice.

    <div class="talk-text">
      A series of interactive outreach activities we co-organized and ran as PhD students for the Jena “Long Night of Sciences,” including on-site guidance for student groups and family-visit tour support. 
      One example was an ATTO eddy-covariance tower “climbing” simulator that let visitors experience fieldwork safety and perspective changes with height: participants wore a helmet and safety harness, stepped on pedals to “ascend,” and watched the landscape view update on a screen—bringing Amazon rainforest research to life.
